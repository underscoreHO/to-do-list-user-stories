# To Do List Application

In this exercise, you'll be implementing part of a To Do List application.

Here are the user stories for the To Do List application. These are intentionally vague when it comes to implementation - use your best judgment! 

Use Postman to test your code and make sure the functionality works how you expect it to, and use TDD!

It is not imperitive that you complete all of the user stories, shoot to get through the Basic Requirements, up through #7 - the rest are Advanced Content that we highly encourage you tackle if you finish the first 7.
